In the second training we aim to go deeper into specific tools that build on top of Kubernetes.

First, we discuss Package Management in Kubernetes using HELM. We explain the concepts of Charts and the HELM client together with Chart Repositories. Then, we go into Monitoring using Prometheus. Here, the concepts of Alerts and Targets are explained, the Prometheus architecture, its query language (PromQL) and how to use it in conjunction with the Grafana analytics platform. Next, we cover Istio, a Service Mesh, i.e. a distributed system of microservices. We delve into the fallacies of distributed computing that it aims to solve, its architecture, and core features. Finally, we will focus on Kubeflow, the Machine Learning toolkit for Kubernetes.  Each of these tools is accompanied by a lab exercise that will give us some hands-on experience.

The training includes theory, demos, and hands-on exercises. After this training you will have gained knowledge about the architecture, usage and (dis)advantages of:

- HELM: package management for Kubernetes
- Prometheus: monitoring
- Istio: service meshes
- Kubeflow: machine learning toolkit
- Lab session to get hands-on experience with these tools
