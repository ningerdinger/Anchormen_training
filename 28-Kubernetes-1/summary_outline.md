This training aims to give an overview of what Kubernetes does, how it works and how to use it in practice. It is part 1 of 2 courses on this topic.

First, we will discuss the core principles such as containers, clusters, container dependencies, image registries, deployments, load balancing, scaling, etc before going in more detail into the main components of Kubernetes clusters, i.e. (master) nodes, pods, services and replication controllers. We then move to more practical information about how to use the kubectl command line tool, writing specification files and the Kubernetes Dashboard.

After this theoretical overview we gain hands-on experience in a two-part lab session, in which we learn how to set up a local Kubernetes cluster and deploy applications in practice.

The training includes theory, demos, and hands-on exercises. After this training you will have gained knowledge about:

- Recap Docker and Docker Compose
- Container automation & orchestration
- Container dependencies
- Image registries
- Automated deployments
- Features such as load balancing, health checks, scaling and rolling updates
- Cluster components: master, nodes, pods, services, replication controllers, labels
- Kubectl command line
- Specification files (yaml, json)
- Kubernetes Dashboard
- Lab session to get hands-on experience deploying apps in a Kubernetes Cluster
